# quote-generator
This will generate random quote drawn from the quotes repository

It includes an object array named quotes, which includes the quote, citation, source, year, and tag of the quote.

The getRandomQuote() function will randomly draw the object from the array.

The getRandomNumber and getRandomColor functions together will create random color and assign it to the background color.

The printQuote function will print the objects with format onto the browser and the app should display a new quote each time the user clicks the "Show another quote" button using a printQuote function.

Finally the setInterval method will print a new quote to the page at regular intervals of every 10 seconds.
